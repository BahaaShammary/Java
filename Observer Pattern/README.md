# The Observer Pattern

Definition: Observer is a behavioral design pattern. It specifies communication between objects: observable and observers. An observable is an object which notifies observers about the changes in its state.

The application made is about how Youtube has channels and subscribers. So basically, instead of Subscribers in real life, checking every two minutes if the channel uploaded a video, we make it so that channels notify the subscribers if a video has been uploaded. This is done using the Observer Pattern.
